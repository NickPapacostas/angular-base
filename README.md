Simple Sinatra app that uses Haml and AngularJS

Pulled from https://github.com/dannolan/angularjs-sinatra-bootstrap-template

This repository provides a very basic template for getting an AngularJS app up and running on top of a Sinatra server. Comes with Twitter Bootstrap, its own version of jquery (1.9 at current state) and little else.
